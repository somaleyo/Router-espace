                                <p className='texte'>  A space capsule is an often-crewed spacecraft that uses a blunt-body reentry 
                                capsule to reenter the Earth's atmosphere without wings. Our capsule is where 
                                you'll spend your time during the flight. It includes a space gym, cinema, 
                                and plenty of other activities to keep you entertained.</p>
